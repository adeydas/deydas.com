So you got a new home and along with all the excitement and joy that comes with a new home, came a 25 yr long mortgage. In this post, we will analyze different strategies to payoff a mortgage. We will explore how compound interest interplays with different payment cadences, one-time payments, etc.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this blog post is for educational purposes only.*

Before we dive into the different strategies, let's set some baselines. Let's say
1. We have a **loan amount of $520,000**.
2. Our **annual interest rate is 3.14%**.
3. Our **term length is 25 years or 300 months**.
4. We have a **fixed rate till 5 years** and then it changes to a variable rate.
5. Our **variable interest rate minimum is 3.38%** (following Bank of Canada prime rate for today and median of standard deduction by the big 3 banks).
6. Our **variable interest rate cap is 5%**. Historically Bank of Canada has gone up to about 4%. We take 5% for our calculations.
7. Interest rate adjustments are done every **12 months**.
8. **Interest rate adjustments are 0.25%** (approximately follows Bank of Canada rate adjustments).
9. The mortgate is **compounded semi-annually**. This is true for all Canadian mortgages.

Alright, now that we have the baselines established, let's move on to the strategies.

## Strategy #1: monthly payments for 300 months
The most common way to pay off a mortgage - we pay off a portion of the interest and principal, every month, for the next 300 months. We get a pretty standard amortization plot and payment schedule.

<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbtQAIX0fwThzTDhdMsv2IuK0zme-LMmzXbPDOyImmWSbfR90wN83JZHhJsWdcPywU2g-eUPMq_jGX/pubhtml?gid=2090311576&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

The red cells represent when we are paying more interest than principal. If we pay a fixed amount every month, we will start paying off more principal than interest from the **35th month** of the mortgage. Our **mortgage payment per month would be $2,498.38** and we would have **saved $0 in interest**.

## Strategy #2: accelerated bi-weekly payments
Accelerated bi-weekly is, as the name suggests, paying every 2 weeks instead of every month. Which means we will be paying an extra week every year. Let's see how our amortization table looks with that.

<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbtQAIX0fwThzTDhdMsv2IuK0zme-LMmzXbPDOyImmWSbfR90wN83JZHhJsWdcPywU2g-eUPMq_jGX/pubhtml?gid=93437483&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

As we can see, we will start paying off more principal than interest right off the bat. Also we will be paying off our mortgage in approximately 23 years and our **mortgate payment every 2 weeks would be $1,249.19** and we would have **saved $35,298.57 in interest**. Assuming we get paid monthly, a bi-weekly payment schedule would cost us $2,498.38, the exact same amount as a monthly mortgage except the 1 extra week per year.

## Strategy #3: accelerated weekly payments
Similar to strategy #2 but every week instead of every 2 weeks.

Again we gain equity right off the bat. Also we will be paying off our mortgate in approximately 22.7 years and our **mortgage payment every week would be $672.60** and we would have **saved $39,194.03 in interest**. On a monthly cadence, we would have **paid $2,690.40 per month** with 2 extra weeks per year.

Those are the 3 most straight forward strategies. Now let's say we choose strategy 2 because we pay only slightly more per year than strategy #1, how can we further reduce the interest paid over the lifetime of the mortgage?

## Strategy #4: Making an extra annual payment with accelerated bi-weekly payments
Now let's say we save up and make an extra payment every year. Most banks would allow up to 10% of extra payments, so let's factor that in. For a mortgage of $520,000 though, that's a whooping $52,000. Let's say we don't have that money. So we drop it to 1%, or $5,200 and repeat for the term of the loan. That would save us **$42,025.57 in interest**. $5,200 per year is about $433 per month or $216.50 every 2 weeks approximately. 

So combining this with strategy #2, by **paying $2,938.31 every month**, we would save **$42,025.57 in interest**.

## Strategy #5: Payment increase with accelerated bi-weekly payments
Let's say we want to increase our bi-weekly payments every year by a small percentage. That percentage could depend on increase in income, inflation and new expenses. Let's say we want to **increase our payments by 10% or $124.92 and repeat for 24 years**. That would save us **$82,169.84 in interest over the term of the loan**. I say term of the loan because the term then, would be reduced by about 10 years and 9 months.

## Strategy #6: Extra annual payment with payment increase with accelerated bi-weekly payments
With the 3 strategies combined (3, 4 and 5), we would **save $94,176.73 in interest** with the following schedule:
1. We would make 10 payments of $5,200.00 each, every year for 10 years, amounting to $52,000.
2. We would have 10 increases of $124.92 each, every year for 10 years.

We are saying 10 years because we will be done with our mortgate payments by the end of the 11th year. Here's the payment schedule:

## Conclusion
All of the strategies above, for simplicity's sake, does not do a comparitive analysis of investing the extra money in a fund with a growth of, let's say, 7% compounded annually. For instance, instead of paying $5,200 extra annually, we could invest that in a fund that pays a 7% dividend. At that compound interest, at the end of 10 years, that fund would grow to $82,074.72. 

Then you would have to decide whether it's worth paying off the mortgage or investing the surplus in a fund. But that's fodder for a subsequent post.
