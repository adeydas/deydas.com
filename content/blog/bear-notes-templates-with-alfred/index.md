I am a big fan of Bear and for me, the much-desired feature is support for templates. So while the Bear team works on it, hereâ€™s a workaround with Alfred.

First you will need to create a snippet in Alfred. To do that, go to Alfred Preferences > Features > Snippets and create a new one with the following markdown code:

```
## Meeting title  

## Time {datetime}  

## Attendees   

## Meeting minutes  

## Action items 
    - Item 1
```

Alfred supports dynamic content, so {datetime} would render the current date and time. You may also add in hashtags and such. Once you are done, you will probably end up with something like this:

![Alfred dynamic content](./dynamic-content-alfred.png)

Save that, close the Alfred Preferences window and go back to Bear. In Bear, create a new note, bring up the Alfred search bar using Option + Space (default setting) and type in snip meeting.

![Alfred meeting shortcut](./alfred-meeting-shortcut.png)

Make sure your Bear note is in focus when you run the above command. Alfred will then paste your meeting snippet into your Bear note.

![New bear note](./new-bear-note.png)

Ofcourse this is not restricted to just Bear. You could use this Alfred function with pretty much any app.

Happy note taking!
